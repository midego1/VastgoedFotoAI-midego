## Choosing the Right Template

Consider these factors when selecting a template:

1. **Property type** – Match the template to the home's character
2. **Target audience** – Who will be viewing these listings?
3. **Season and lighting** – Consider when photos were taken
4. **Consistency** – Use the same template across a property

## Preview Before Processing

Always use the preview feature to see how a template will affect your specific photos. Different source images may respond differently to the same template.

## Custom Adjustments

After applying a template, you can fine-tune results with manual adjustments:
- Brightness and contrast
- Color temperature
- Shadow and highlight recovery
