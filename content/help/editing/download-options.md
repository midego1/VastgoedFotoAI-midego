## Download Formats

### Single Image Download
Click on any enhanced image, then click the download button. The image downloads immediately in your selected format.

### Batch Download
Download all enhanced images at once:

1. Click **Download All** in your project
2. Choose your format preference
3. AI Studio creates a ZIP file
4. Download begins automatically

1. Select images by clicking their checkboxes
2. Click **Download Selected**
3. Receive only your chosen images

## File Naming

Downloaded files follow this naming convention:

```
original-filename_enhanced.jpg
```

For batch downloads, files are organized in a folder named after your project.

## Storage and Access

### How Long Are Photos Stored?

- **Active projects**: Indefinitely while your account is active

### Re-downloading

Return to any project within the storage period to download your enhanced images again. No additional credits are charged for re-downloads.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Download high-res first** – You can always compress later
2. **Keep originals** – AI Studio stores them, but local backups are smart
3. **Check before sharing** – Review each image at full size
4. **Organize downloads** – Create folders by property or date
