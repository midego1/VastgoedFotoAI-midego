Batch processing allows you to enhance multiple photos simultaneously, applying the same style template and settings across all images. This is perfect for processing entire property shoots efficiently.

## How Batch Processing Works

1. **Upload multiple photos** to a single project
2. **Select your style template** – it applies to all photos
3. **Start processing** – VastgoedFotoAI.nl handles each photo automatically
4. **Download all** enhanced images at once

## Processing Times

Batch processing times depend on several factors:

| Photos | Estimated Time |
|--------|----------------|
| 1–10   | 1–5 minutes    |
| 11–25  | 5–15 minutes   |
| 26–50  | 15–30 minutes  |

**Processing happens in parallel.** Larger batches benefit from efficiency gains – 50 photos don't take 5× longer than 10 photos.

## Best Practices

### Consistent Source Photos

For best results across a batch, ensure your source photos have:
- Similar lighting conditions
- Consistent white balance
- Comparable exposure levels

### Organize by Room Type

Consider creating separate projects for:
- Interior shots
- Exterior shots
- Detail shots

This allows you to apply different templates optimized for each type.

### Review Before Download

Always review processed images individually before downloading. You can:
- Re-process individual photos with different settings
- Exclude photos from the final download
- Make manual adjustments as needed

<div class="callout-tip">

Create a "hero shots" project first with your best 5–10 images. Once you find the perfect template, apply it to the full batch.

## Managing Large Batches

For properties with many photos, consider:

1. **Prioritize key shots** – Process hero images first
2. **Group similar photos** – Process similar rooms together
3. **Use consistent naming** – Rename files for easy organization

## Download Options

After processing, download your enhanced photos:
- **Individual downloads** – Click any image to download
- **Batch download** – Download all as a ZIP file
- **Select downloads** – Choose specific images to include
