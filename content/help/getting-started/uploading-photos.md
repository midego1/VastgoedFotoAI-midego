Getting great results from AI Studio starts with uploading quality source photos. Here's everything you need to know about the upload process.

## Supported Formats

AI Studio accepts the following image formats:

| Format | Max Size | Recommended |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| JPEG   | 25 MB    | Yes         |
| PNG    | 25 MB    | Yes         |
| WebP   | 25 MB    | Yes         |

## Upload Methods

### Drag and Drop
The easiest way to upload is to drag files directly from your computer into the upload area.

### File Browser
Click the upload area to open your system's file browser and select photos.

### Bulk Upload
Select multiple files at once by holding `Shift` or `Cmd/Ctrl` while clicking files.

## Photo Requirements

For optimal AI enhancement results, your source photos should:

1. **Be high resolution** – At least 1920×1080 pixels recommended
2. **Have good exposure** – Avoid extremely dark or overexposed images
3. **Be properly focused** – Blurry source photos will produce blurry results
4. **Use minimal compression** – Heavily compressed JPEGs may show artifacts

## What Happens After Upload

Once uploaded, your photos are:

1. Securely stored in our cloud infrastructure
2. Analyzed by our AI for optimal enhancement settings
3. Ready for style template application

Your original photos are always preserved—AI Studio creates enhanced copies without modifying your originals.

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Failed
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure the file is under 25 MB
- Try a different browser if issues persist

### Photo Looks Different After Upload
- This is normal—we display a preview thumbnail
- Full quality is preserved for processing

### Can't Select Multiple Files
- Hold `Shift` to select a range
- Hold `Cmd` (Mac) or `Ctrl` (Windows) to select individual files
