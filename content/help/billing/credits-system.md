## Checking Your Balance

View your credit balance:

1. Click your profile icon in the top right
2. Select **Billing** from the dropdown
3. Your current balance is displayed at the top

You'll also see:
- Credits used this billing period
- Credits remaining until renewal
- Next renewal date

## Credit Renewal

For subscription plans, credits renew monthly on your billing date:

- New credits are added to your account
- Unused credits from previous month roll over
- Maximum rollover: 2x your monthly allocation

**Example**: Professional plan (200 credits/month) with 50 unused credits will have 250 credits after renewal.

## Low Credit Alerts

AI Studio notifies you when credits run low:

- **25% remaining** – Dashboard notification
- **10% remaining** – Email notification
- **0% remaining** – Prompted to add credits

## Purchasing Additional Credits

Need more credits mid-cycle? Add them anytime:

1. Go to **Billing** in your settings
