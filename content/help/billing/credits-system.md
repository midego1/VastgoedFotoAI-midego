Credits are the simple way VastgoedFotoAI.nl tracks usage. One credit equals one photo enhancement—no complicated calculations needed.

## Credit Usage

| Action | Credits |
|--------|---------|
| Enhance a photo | 1 credit |
| Re-process with different template | 1 credit |
| Download enhanced photo | Free |
| Re-download same photo | Free |
| Upload photos | Free |
| Preview templates | Free |

<div class="callout-info">

**Only processing costs credits.** Uploading, previewing, downloading, and team collaboration are all free.

</div>

## Checking Your Balance

View your credit balance:

1. Click your profile icon in the top right
2. Select **Billing** from the dropdown
3. Your current balance is displayed at the top

You'll also see:
- Credits used this billing period
- Credits remaining until renewal
- Next renewal date

## Credit Renewal

For subscription plans, credits renew monthly on your billing date:

- New credits are added to your account
- Unused credits from previous month roll over
- Maximum rollover: 2× your monthly allocation

<div class="callout-tip">

**Example:** Professional plan (200 credits/month) with 50 unused credits will have 250 credits after renewal.

</div>

## Low Credit Alerts

VastgoedFotoAI.nl notifies you when credits run low:

| Balance | Notification |
|---------|--------------|
| 25% remaining | Dashboard notification |
| 10% remaining | Email notification |
| 0% remaining | Prompted to add credits |
