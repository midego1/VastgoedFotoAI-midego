Sometimes the best way to understand what's possible is to see real results. Here are actual before-and-after examples from VastgoedFotoAI.nl users, showing how AI enhancement transforms everyday property photos into listing-ready visuals.

## Dark Living Room to Bright, Inviting Space

**The Challenge**: A north-facing living room photographed on an overcast day. The original image was dark, with muddy colors and no sense of warmth.

**The Result**: VastgoedFotoAI.nl brightened the space naturally, revealing the true colors of the furnishings while maintaining realistic lighting. The windows show proper exposure without blown-out highlights.

**User Feedback**: "I was ready to schedule a reshoot. VastgoedFotoAI.nl saved me a trip back to the property and got the listing up same-day."

## Exterior Shot: From Flat to Fantastic

**The Challenge**: A beautiful home photographed under harsh midday sun. The flat lighting made the facade look uninspiring, with the sky completely white and the landscaping in shadow.

**The Result**: Balanced exposure brought back sky detail while lifting shadows to reveal the landscaping. Colors were enhanced to show the true character of the property.

**User Feedback**: "The seller called to ask which photographer I'd used. When I told her I'd done it myself with AI enhancement, she was amazed."

## Kitchen: Correcting Mixed Lighting

**The Challenge**: A modern kitchen with warm under-cabinet lighting and cool daylight from windows. The original photo had an unpleasant green cast from the mixed light sources.

**The Result**: VastgoedFotoAI.nl corrected the white balance throughout the image while preserving the warm accent lighting. The result is clean and natural without looking over-processed.

**User Feedback**: "Mixed lighting has always been my nemesis. This tool handles it perfectly every time."

## Bathroom: Making Small Spaces Shine

**The Challenge**: A small bathroom that photographed dark and cramped. The white tiles appeared gray, and the fixture finishes looked dull.

**The Result**: Brightening revealed the true white of the tiles, and enhanced clarity brought out the shine in fixtures. The space feels clean and well-maintained.

**User Feedback**: "Bathrooms are the hardest rooms to photograph. VastgoedFotoAI.nl makes them look as good as they do in person."

## Bedroom: Warm and Welcoming

**The Challenge**: A master bedroom with beautiful natural light but a cold, uninviting feel in the original photo. Colors appeared washed out.

**The Result**: Gentle warming and color enhancement brought out the coziness of the space. The bedding looks plush, the natural light feels golden, and the room invites you to imagine living there.

**User Feedback**: "My engagement metrics jumped significantly after I started using VastgoedFotoAI.nl on all my bedroom shots."

## Outdoor Living Space

**The Challenge**: A patio photographed late in the day with harsh shadows and bright spots. The original image felt chaotic and didn't convey the relaxing atmosphere of the space.

**The Result**: Shadow lifting and highlight recovery brought everything into balance. Enhanced colors showed off the plantings, and the overall feel became inviting and aspirational.

**User Feedback**: "Outdoor spaces sell homes, especially in summer. These photos helped a listing get three offers in the first week."

1. **Natural results** — Every enhancement looks realistic, not over-processed
