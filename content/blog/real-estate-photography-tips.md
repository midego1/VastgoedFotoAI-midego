Whether you're a real estate agent snapping quick photos or a dedicated property photographer, these tips will help you capture images that make buyers stop scrolling and start dreaming.

## 1. Time Your Shoots Right

The golden hours — shortly after sunrise and before sunset — provide the most flattering natural light. Midday sun creates harsh shadows that are difficult to correct, even with AI enhancement.

For interior shots, overcast days actually work better. The diffused light reduces contrast and harsh shadows, making rooms appear larger and more inviting.

## 2. Declutter Ruthlessly

Remove everything that isn't essential to showing the space. This includes:

- Personal photos and memorabilia
- Excessive furniture
- Countertop appliances
- Bathroom products
- Trash bins

A decluttered space photographs larger and helps buyers imagine their own belongings in the home.

## 3. Use a Wide-Angle Lens (But Not Too Wide)

A 16-24mm lens on a full-frame camera (or equivalent) strikes the perfect balance between showing space and avoiding distortion. Ultra-wide lenses make rooms look unnaturally large and can create bizarre proportions.

Smartphone cameras with wide-angle modes work well for quick shots, but be mindful of the barrel distortion at the edges.

## 4. Shoot From Corners

Position yourself in a corner of the room and shoot diagonally across the space. This technique shows three walls instead of two, creating depth and making rooms appear larger.

Keep your camera at chest height — too high creates an unnatural perspective, too low emphasizes floors over living space.

## 5. Turn On Every Light

Even in well-lit rooms, turn on all lights including:

- Overhead fixtures
- Lamps
- Under-cabinet lighting
- Accent lights

This creates a warm, inviting atmosphere and ensures no dark corners. Modern cameras and AI enhancement handle mixed lighting well.

## 6. Stage Key Rooms

Focus your staging efforts on the rooms that matter most:

- Kitchen — Add fresh flowers and a bowl of fruit
- Living room — Arrange pillows and throws
- Master bedroom — Fresh linens and minimal furniture
- Bathroom — Rolled towels and simple accessories

You don't need to stage every room, but these key spaces should look their best.

## 7. Don't Forget the Exterior

Curb appeal sells homes. Capture the exterior from multiple angles:

- Straight-on shot showing the full facade
- Angled shot for depth
- Detail shots of architectural features
- Garden and outdoor living spaces

If possible, photograph when cars are moved and bins are hidden.

## 8. Take More Photos Than You Need

Storage is cheap. Take multiple shots of each angle with different exposures. Having options means you can choose the best shot later, and bracketed exposures allow for HDR processing if needed.

## 9. Check Your Verticals

Nothing looks more amateur than tilted walls. Use your camera's grid overlay to ensure vertical lines are truly vertical. Most cameras and phones have a level indicator — use it.

If you do end up with tilted photos, most editing software can correct this, but it's better to get it right in camera.

## 10. Process Consistently

All your listing photos should have a consistent look. This creates a professional presentation and helps establish your visual brand.

VastgoedFotoAI.nl's presets ensure consistency across all your photos automatically, saving hours of manual editing while delivering professional results.

## The Bottom Line

Great real estate photography isn't about expensive equipment — it's about understanding light, composition, and what buyers want to see. Combine these techniques with AI enhancement, and you'll create listings that stand out in any market.
